                <h2>Who Am I</h2>
                <p>I have a coding philosophy that values communication and community to solve complex problems. Having just finished being a teaching assistant for a coding school, I have learned how to cultivate an environment that empowers all voices in the (Zoom) room. I also saw firsthand how success can only be attained through open communication.</p>
                <p>Iâ€™m currently working on a project to better reach the disabled community, who we are interviewing to guide our design using semantic HTML. We are using the most up-to-date React practices and the latest testing libraries to ensure that our website is fully accessible for everyone. Using these skills, along with new ones I am constantly obtaining, I am sure to learn through my life. I want to bring the same focus on community by using open communication and accessibility driven development to future projects.</p>
